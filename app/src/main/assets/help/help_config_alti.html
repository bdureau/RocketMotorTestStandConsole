<h1>Configure altimeter</h1>
<p>The altimeter configuration can be up to 4 differents screens depending of the altimeter you are connected to.
    When opening these screen you are connected to the altimeter and retrieving the altemiter configuration stored on the board memory</p>
<p><strong>Altimeter Outputs</strong></p>
<p>Each output of the altimeter can be configured and assigned a functionnality. Fonctionnalities are event driven. The
following events are available:</p>
<p>- Lift off (fire at lift off)</p>
<p>- Timer (fire X miliseconds after liftoff)</p>
<p>- Altitude (fire at the specified altidude)</p>
<p>- Apogee (fire at apogee)</p>
<p>- Main (fire X meters before landing)</p>
<p>- Landing (fire on landing)</p>
<p>Note that for each events you can also have a delay in miliseconds</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Altimeter config</strong></p>
<p>- Baud Rate
    Allow to change the altimeter communication speed (reboot required)</p>
<p>-Apogee measures
    The number of measures required to detect apogee</p>
<p>- Altimeter Res
    The altimeter resolution(be carefull changing it will reduce the number of measures do not do it if you use the altimeter to deploy parachutes)</p>
<p>- EEprom size
    Allow you to change the on board memory size</p>
<p>- Beep ON/Off
    You can turn ON or OFF the continuity beep</p>
<p>- End of rec altitude
    At which altitude do you stop recording</p>
<p>- Record temp</p>
<p>- Supersonic delay</p>
<p>- Lift Off Altitude
At which altitude do we consider that lift off as occured</p>
<p>- Battery type
Define the battery type used, the is used by some altimeters to warn on battery low voltage</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Altimeter config (page 2)</strong></p>
<p>Allow to choose the altimeter units, the beep mode and the beep frequency</p>
<p><strong>Servo config</strong></p>
<p>This is only available when connected to the altiServo, It will allow to choose the servo start ans stop position</p>
