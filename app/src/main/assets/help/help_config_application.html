<h1>Configure Bear Console Application</h1>
<p>The configuration is divided in 2 screens</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>- Application langage (not used for now because the application langage will be the phone language)</p>
<p>- Graph color</p>
<p>- Application Units </p>
<p>- Graph background color (make sure that it is different from the graph color!!!) </p>
<p>- font size </p>
<p>- Baud rate (this is for the USB cable, it has to be the same as the altimeter baud rate) </p>
<p>- Connection type can be bluetooth or USB if you want to do long distance telemetry) </p>
<p>- Graphics library (allow to choose between 2 lib type, be carefull that on Android 8 and above you will crash your phone if you do not use the MPAndroid chart lib) </p>
<p>- Multiple Main/drogue
Alow you to define more than one output as a main or a drogue</p>
<p>- Full USB support
Only enable it if you use USB with a cable. If using longue range telemetry do not use it to avoid corrupting your altimeter configs</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Telemetry config</strong></p>
<p>Allow to configure which telemetry event are said. Allow also to change the telemetry voice.
If you want to test the telemetry voice just press the [Test voice] button</p>
<p> </p>
