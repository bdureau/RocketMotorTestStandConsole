<p>- Graph color</p>
<p>- Application Units </p>
<p>- Graph background color (make sure that it is different from the graph color!!!) </p>
<p>- font size </p>
<p>- Baud rate (this is for the USB cable, it has to be the same as the altimeter baud rate) </p>
<p>- Connection type can be bluetooth or USB if you want to do long distance telemetry) </p>
<p>- Graphics library (allow to choose between 2 lib type, be carefull that on Android 8 and above you will crash your phone if you do not use the MPAndroid chart lib) </p>
<p>- Full USB support
Only enable it if you use USB with a cable. If using longue range telemetry do not use it to avoid corrupting your TestStand configs</p>
