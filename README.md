Board firmware can be found here
https://github.com/bdureau/MotorTestStand

If you want to make sure that the board firmware and Android app are compatible, install the Android app and flash your board firmware with it.
The Android app is available from the store. 
I am looking for help to translate the app to other languages if your language is not English and you want to contribute please contact me.
